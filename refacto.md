# retrospective : refacto, todos, comments...

- name better html classes
- organize better css (or use scss)
- javascript more readable
- fix `onMouseMove` eye position calculations in percentage
- take more space for large screens (cf. `large-screen.jpg`)

## questions, wondering

- better to use `requestAnimationFrame` for text animations ? or `setInterval` and clear when timeout ?
- is it bad practice to use `calc` for main content ? (cf. main.height in `style.css`)
- would `display: grid` have been better for main content rather than `flex` ? so i don't have to use flex-wrap
- should have started as mobile first for css ?
